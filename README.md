## Welcome to My GitHub

Hey there! I’m Tobit — a computer science student at Ghent University with a love for both coding and music.

### About Me

I mostly work in **Java** (it's my go-to), but I’ve recently been diving into **Haskell**, which has been a fun challenge. For quick jobs or little automations, I often turn to **Bash**.

Biggest struggle? Linker errors. Enough said.

I enjoy working solo when I want full control, but I also like teaming up on projects — collaboration always brings fresh ideas to the table.

When I hit a wall, my process usually looks like this:

1. Google it
2. Google it again
3. Ask a friend

### Late-Night Coding Sessions

I do most of my best work late at night — it’s quiet, peaceful, and perfect for getting into the zone. I stick with JetBrains IDEs most of the time (they just get the job done).

### Music Is My Other World

Outside of code, I spend a lot of time making music. I play trumpet in a chamber orchestra, the Ghent University Wind Ensemble, and the Royal Concert Band De Eendracht Wachtebeke.
I also sing bass in the Ghent University Choir.

When I’m not rehearsing or performing, I’m usually in my room producing music, blending different genres, and seeing where inspiration takes me.

### What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is a mix of practical stuff and experimental side projects — things I build for fun, out of curiosity, or just to learn something new.
