## Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there! I’m Tobit, a computer science student at the University of Ghent with a passion for both coding and music.

### About Me

Languages I Work With: Java (my go-to) and Haskell (a new, intriguing challenge).

Biggest Challenge: Linker errors – they never fail to test my patience.

Work Style: I enjoy both solo projects and collaborations. Each has its perks.

Problem-Solving Approach: Google is my first stop; if that fails, I ask a friend.


### Night Owl Coder

I tend to work late into the night – the quiet hours are perfect for tackling tough problems. My IDEs of choice are the JetBrains suite.

### Music and More

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me making music:

Playing trumpet in a chamber orchestra, the Ghent University Wind Ensemble and the Royal Concert Band De Eendracht Wachtebeke

Singing bass in the Ghent University Choir

Producing my own tracks and experimenting with different genres.


### What’s Here
