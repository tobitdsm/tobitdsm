## Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there! Iâ€™m Tobit, a computer science student at the University of Ghent with a passion for both coding and music.

### About Me

Languages I Work With: Java (my go-to) and Haskell (a new, intriguing challenge).

Biggest Challenge: Linker errors â€“ they never fail to test my patience.

Work Style: I enjoy both solo projects and collaborations. Each has its perks.

Problem-Solving Approach: Google is my first stop; if that fails, I ask a friend.


### Night Owl Coder

I tend to work late into the night â€“ the quiet hours are perfect for tackling tough problems. My IDEs of choice are the JetBrains suite.

### Music and More

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me making music:

Playing trumpet in 2 wind orchestras and a chamber orchestra ðŸŽº.

Singing bass in a choir ðŸŽ¤.

Producing my own tracks and experimenting with different genres.


### Whatâ€™s Here
